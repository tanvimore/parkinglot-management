# parkinglot-management
The parking lot layout is first uploaded. The program
detects the green zone in the parking layout(i.e. the slot
available for visitors).
The visitor needs to fill his information along with the
person he or she is visiting.
According to the block the visitor wants to visit , the
program keeps the count of total no of visits.
Once the first entry is done, the program asks if the user
wants to continue or not.
By the above method, the user can add any number of
enteries required.
Once the program is terminated, the program encodes and
displays the total no of visitors visiting each block.
